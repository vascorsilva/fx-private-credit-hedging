# FX-Hedged Private Credit Case Study

## Overview

This repository presents a quantitative case study analysing the impact of foreign exchange (FX) risk on a EUR-denominated private credit investment from the perspective of a USD-based investor.

The core objectives of the analysis are to:

- Quantify the distribution of USD investment performance metrics induced by FX uncertainty.
- Design and evaluate FX hedging strategies that modify this distribution in a controlled manner.
- Compare hedging strategies in terms of downside risk reduction, cost, and impact on upside potential.

The analysis focuses exclusively on FX risk. All other risk dimensions (credit risk, liquidity risk, interest-rate risk, counterparty risk) are deliberately held fixed in order to isolate FX effects and maintain a clean, auditable framework.

Three strategies are considered:

- Unhedged EUR exposure.
- FX forward hedging.
- FX option hedging using ATM-forward EUR put options.

The analysis is implemented primarily in a Jupyter notebook, supported by modular Python code.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fx-hedged-private-credit-case-study
   ```

2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment.

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
3. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. Open the notebook:

## Data Inputs

### Market Data

Market data is provided via the Excel file `QuantResearch-CaseStudy-MarketData-25.xlsx` and includes:

- EURUSD spot rates (bid, mid, ask).
- ATM implied volatilities at 1Y and 5Y maturities.
- Volatility smile components (25-delta risk reversals and butterflies).

Design choices:

- Spot **mid** quotes are used for FX path simulation.
- Implied volatility **ask** quotes are used for option pricing (reflecting a buy-side perspective).
- Volatility smile information (risk reversals and butterflies) is intentionally ignored.

---

### Cashflow Data

The investment cashflows are deterministic in EUR and follow a **bullet-loan-style profile**, consisting of:

- An initial EUR principal outflow.
- Periodic EUR coupon inflows.
- A final EUR principal repayment.

Cashflows are converted to USD pathwise using simulated FX rates.

For option strategies, an additional USD cashflow is introduced at the valuation date to represent upfront option premium payment.

---

## Global Configuration

All modelling parameters and assumptions are centralised via a global configuration object, including:

- Valuation (analysis) date.
- Number of Monte Carlo simulation paths.
- Time discretisation on a business-day grid.
- FX drift and volatility assumptions.
- USD discount rate used for investment evaluation.
- Hedging ratio.
- Domestic and foreign interest-rate proxies used for FX derivative pricing.

This design ensures consistency across strategies, transparency of assumptions, and ease of extensibility.

## FX Spot Rate Simulation

FX spot rates are simulated using a geometric Brownian motion (GBM).

Volatility is estimated from historical daily log returns using business-day sampling. Weekend effects are implicitly embedded through Friday to Monday returns.

Simulation is performed on a business-day grid. Each business-day step represents the cumulative FX movement since the previous trading day.

---

## Performance Metrics

The following performance metrics are computed for each path:

- Net Present Value (NPV): Measures value creation in USD terms.
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR): Measures annualised return.
- Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC): Measures capital efficiency.
- Terminal USD Value: Measures the final USD outcome.

---

## Hedging Strategies

### Unhedged Strategy

The unhedged strategy converts EUR cashflows to USD using simulated FX spot rates without any hedging instruments.

This strategy serves as the baseline FX risk exposure.

---

### Forward Hedge Strategy

The forward hedge implements a static, cashflow-by-cashflow FX forward hedge:

- 100% of EUR inflows are hedged.
- Hedge is established at the valuation date.
- Each EUR cashflow is converted to USD using its corresponding forward rate.

FX uncertainty on inflows is largely eliminated, resulting in tightly concentrated outcome distributions.

---

### Option Hedge Strategy

The option hedge consists of purchasing ATMF EUR put options:

- Strike set equal to the forward rate for each cashflow maturity.
- Premium paid upfront at the valuation date.
- Downside FX risk is capped, while upside appreciation is preserved.

This introduces convexity into the payoff profile at the cost of an upfront premium.

---

## Results and Interpretation

Results are presented as:

- Summary tables of performance and risk metrics.
- Distributional plots comparing strategies.
- Tail-risk comparisons across strategies.

Key qualitative patterns:

- Forward hedging significantly compresses outcome distributions.
- Option hedging truncates left tails while retaining right-tail upside.
- Unhedged exposure exhibits the widest dispersion and largest downside risk.

---

## Assumptions and Limitations

The framework relies on the following explicit assumptions:

- 100% hedging of EUR inflows.
- Static, cashflow-by-cashflow hedging.
- No transaction costs except option premiums.
- No counterparty default risk.
- Deterministic interest rates.
- Flat interest-rate term structures.
- No cross-currency basis.
- ATMF option strikes.
- FX spot as the sole stochastic driver.

These assumptions are deliberate design choices that keep the analysis focused, interpretable, and extensible.
